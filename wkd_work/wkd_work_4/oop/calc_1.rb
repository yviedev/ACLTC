# Below, we have two types of calculators. The simple one can perform basic arithmetic, 
# while the fancy one can also do square roots in addition to basic arithmetic.
# There is nothing wrong with the code below per se, but there is duplication
# between the two classes, since they each contain four identical methods.
# This is generally considered to be a code design flaw, since there may come
# a time where we decide to change how these methods work, and we may accidentally
# update the methods in one class, and forget to update them in the other, and our
# two classes become out of sync. This known as the DRY principle, that is:
# Don't Repeat Yourself.
# There are a number of techniques that we can use to fix this example. One is 
# a fundamental concept in OOP known as Inheritance. Your exercise is to research 
# Inheritance in Ruby, and use it to remove the duplication (or DRY up) the code 
# below. You must also write the driver code to test your classes.
