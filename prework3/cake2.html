  In other to bake this cake, you will need a few ingredients:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Chocolate chips
  </li>
  <li>
    1 egg
  </li>
  <li>
    1 tsp of sugar
  </li>
  <li>
    1 tsp of baking powder
  </li>
  <li>
    1 cup of flour
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  You will also need a few pieces of hardware.

  </ul>
</ol>
<h4>
  Step 1:
</h4>
<p>
  Start by mixing all of the above-mentioned ingredients together in your ramekin. You don't need a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-Professional-KSM6573CER-Stand-Empire/dp/B00PZU3AEI">professional mixer</a> -- just a metal fork with much hand power.
</p>
<p>
Mixing time: 5 minutes or until you get tired (or whichever one comes last.)
</p>
<h4>
  Step 2:
</h4>
<p>
  Lick the spoon. I assure you this is important for taste purposes. If your cake mix doesn't taste quite right, just improvise and a teeny weeny more of one or more of the above ingredients.
</p>
<h4>
  Step 3:
</h4>
<p>
  Wash your fork. I mean it's just one fork so far that you've used. Fine, drop the fork in the sink. Sheesh.
</p>
<h4>
  Step 4:
</h4>
<p>
  Plug in your microwave. See! That contraption would come in handy some day. Yes, microwaves are probably not great for your health overall, but neither is cake.
</p>
<h4>
  Step 5:
</h4>
<p>
  Stick your ramekin in the microwave for 5 minutes. Please do not stand or sit in front of the microwave while your cake is baking. Go do something else like...watch reality TV.
</p>
<h4>
  Step 6:
</h4>
<p>
  Let your cake cool down for a bit you cake monster. You've waited this long, you can afford to wait a little longer.
</p>
<h4>
  Step 7:
</h4>
<p>
  Remember that fork that I told you to wash? Well if you didn't, you can take it out of the sink and eat your cake. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bon_app%C3%A9tit">Bon Appétit</a>!
