    Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on (ayy, ayy)\n
    I'm beyond all that fudge stuff, hey\n
    \n
    [Verse 1: Lil Yachty]\n
    Hey lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?\n
    Dude touch my gang, we gon' turn this stuff to Columbine\n
    Ice on my neck cost me ten times three\n
    Thirty thousand dollars for a Dude to get flee\n
    I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs\n
    I just did a show and spent the check on my mama\n
    When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas\n
    And I keep like ten phones, damn I'm really never home\n
    All these Dudes clones, tryna copy what I'm on\n
    Dude get your own, tryna pick a Dude bone\n
    Word to brother Skip, boy I had a good day\n
    Metro PCS trappin', boy I'm makin' plays\n
    Fifty shades of grey, beat that meow like Hulk Hogan\n
    I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap I'm gone\n
    Dudes hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete I had rose\n
    Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze\n
    Put that woof up in her meow, bet she feel it in her toes\n
    I'm a real young Dude from the six throwin' 'bows\n
    I'm a real young Dude from the six throwin' 'bows\n
    Real young Dude from the six throwin' 'bows\n
    \n
    [Hook: D.R.A.M.]\n
    In the middle of the party, witch get off me\n
    In the cut I'm rollin' up my broccoli\n
    Ya I know your baby mama fond of me\n
    All she want to do is smoke that broccoli\n
    Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me\n
    Said that I can get that meow easily\n
    Said that I can hit that stuff so greasily\n
    I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily\n
    \n
    [Bridge: D.R.A.M.]\n
    Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on\n
    I'm beyond all that fudge stuff\n
    Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on\n
    I'm beyond all that fudge stuff\n
    \n
    [Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]\n
    I got companies and Pesos\n
    I got people on my payroll\n
    She don't do it 'less I say so\n
    I don't smoke if it ain't fuego\n
    I should sauce 'em up like Prego\n"))
