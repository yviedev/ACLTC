Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on (ayy, ayy)
I'm beyond all that fudge stuff, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Dude touch my gang, we gon' turn this stuff to Columbine
Ice on my neck cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a Dude to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn I'm really never home
All these Dudes clones, tryna copy what I'm on
Dude get your own, tryna pick a Dude bone
Word to brother Skip, boy I had a good day
Metro PCS trappin', boy I'm makin' plays
Fifty shades of grey, beat that meow like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap I'm gone
Dudes hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that woof up in her meow, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young Dude from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young Dude from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young Dude from the six throwin' 'bows

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, witch get off me
In the cut I'm rollin' up my broccoli
Ya I know your baby mama fond of me
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
Said that I can get that meow easily
Said that I can hit that stuff so greasily
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily

[Bridge: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fudge stuff
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fudge stuff

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego"))

What ya twerkin with
I'm some young papi, champagne
They know the face, and they know the name
(Drop that meow boo)
What you twerkin' with?
Work, work, work, work, bounce [x4]
What you twerkin' with [x4]
Work, work, work, work, work, work
What you twerkin' with
Throw it, buss it open
Show me what you twerkin with
Butt so fat, need a lap dance
I'm in that white ghost chasin' Pac man
Hundred out the lot, I be leaning that's a rock
Hundred large bring a mop
Cars tinted like Barack
Got a brinks truck in my pocket (pocket)
30 chains on my collar (collar)
2 drops, no mileage
Top off like Wallace
And I'm hella smoke, boo know that
Filthy rich before rap
Your new deal, I throw that
3 Benz I'm on that
We pop a molly, she buss it up
She seen it, got it, that meow soaking

Work, work, work, work, bounce [x4]
What you twerkin' with [x4]

I love my big booty boos
My life a Godfather picture
Local club in my city
I fell in love with a stripper
boos know I'm that dude
Talkin four door Bugatti
I'm the life of the party let's get these people on the Molly
You know I came to stunt
So drop that meow boo
I got what you want
Drop that meow boo
Film it, film it
This boo want me to film it
Ballin', ballin' like I play for New England
Spend it, spend it, spend a stack every minute
That's 50, 100, I see no  limits
Shout out to Uncle Luke
Shout out my boos too
We the 2 Live Crew
2 for me, 2 for you
Feed them boos carrots
Forget 'em like a rabbit
Sorry that's a habit
Smoke a spliff and then I vanish

Work, work, work, work, bounce [x4]
What you twerkin' with [x4]

I'm about being single, seeing double, making triple (right)
I hope you meow dudes hating never make a nickel
It's good to make it better when your people make it with you
Money coming, money going, ain't like you can take it with you
It's about to be a hit right now, forget back then, we the stuff right now
Dropped 'Take Care', bought a another crib
And I'm picking up the keys to the boo right now
OVO that's major stuff, Toronto with me that's Mayor stuff
Gettin cheddar packs like KD, OKC that's playa stuff
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man, forget you and your time difference
I'm young Papi, champagne
They know the face, and they know the name
Got one watch that could probably pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, 20 bottles that's on me
On the couches, wildin' out
Yelling 'free my homies 'till they all free
One of my closest dawgs got 3 kids and they all 3
But we always been the type of crew that been good without a plan B

Work, work, work, work, bounce [x4]
What you twerkin' with [x4]

Stop talkin' that stuff
And suck a dude for some Trukfit
Okay I forget a boo and I'm gone
That's gangsta Al Capone
I make that meow spit like bone
Talkin' bout Bone, bone, bone, bone
I'm messin' with' French, excuse my French
I lose my mind before I lose my boo
Money ain't a thing but a chicken wing
Boo I ball like 2 eyelids
YMCM-beat that meow up
Stop playin', I make her butt scream and holla, like rock bands
I'm a beast, I'm off the leash
I am rich like a boo
On my pro-active stuff
Pop that meow like a zit
I go by the name Lil Tunechi
Your girl is a groupie
And dude, you's a square
And I would twist you like a rubix
Dude I'm on my skateboard
Watch me do a trick hoe
I'm 5′ 5\"\ but I could 6-9
Then beat that meow like Klitschko
It's French Montana, forget joe
It's Weezy F, forget people
It's Truk the world
It's Truk yo girl
It's Trukfit by the truck load, biaaaatch

Work, work, work, work, bounce [x4]
What you twerkin' with [x4]

Oh yeah, I forgot -
YOUNG MULA BABYYYYYYYY
