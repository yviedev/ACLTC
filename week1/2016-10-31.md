    + Copy and paste the code from the above gist into a new file called employee.rb.
    + Create a new method in your class called full_name. It should return the first name combined with the last name. Also, if the last name ends with the letter s, it should add an “Esquire” at the end. 
    + employee1.full_name should return “Majora Carter”
    + employee2.full_name should return “Danilo Campos, Esquire”
    + Rewrite the initialize method to provide default values if they are missing from the options hash.
