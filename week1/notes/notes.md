##High-level Overview:
* Rails - piece of code that someone else wrote that you can put in your file
* Git vs. Github
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap - makes rules for you. Pain in the neck (we will see on Thursday).
* Schema Design - how your data is connected to each other. Think FB (all of your posts, likes, data.) They need to be able to connect you as a user to their data.
* SQL (Structured Query Language) (PostgreSQL) - language of relational databases
    * NoSQL (Mongo)
* JavaScript - Language used in browser. Logic for your broswer
    * AngularJS - JS framework. Updates page and database at the same time

##Industry Best Practices
* Open Source
* Agile - PM organizational method
* Test Driven Development - a way to write a test to make sure it does a thing
* API's (application program interface) - your website goes to another website, grabs some info an comes back.

##Coding in the Real World:
- Professionalism
- Communication
- Making Tradeoffs
- Working with other people's code
- Working with non-technical people

Pragmatism
- Getting Things Done

Collaboration
- Taking Initiative
- Tinkering
- Always be learning

##Gists - if you copy and paste a gist link into your Medium blog it will output a code box.

##Using the terminal is much faster than navigating through UI folders.
- ls -a shows hidden files. files that start with a . are hidden/system files
- pwd tells you what folder you are in
- ls -l gives you a list
- ls -al 
- la -la does the same thing 
- clear clear terminal, but can scroll up 
- cmd k clear but can't scroll up 
- tab will autocomplete for you which you can use to make sure that you are in the right folder and to prevent typos
- ls - GF 
- teleporting - folder names need to be unique
- cd ../ go back one directory
- mkdir makes new directory (Remmber to cd into that folder)
- touch makes a new file 
- echo Text >> adds text into a new file 
- cat Filename and it will show what is in the file 
- rm removes file. Doesn't confirm delete. There is no way to recover file.
- rmdir removes empty folders 
- rm -rf will delete everything (be careful using this command)
spaces confuse terminal 
- say allows computer to speak
- history 20 shows last 20 commands that you did 
    ! command number
- cd ~ goes to home folder 
- cd / all the way to the root folder (for installing things) 
- cat filename | say => use this command to have the contents of one of the files spoken aloud

##Git
* commits - use in the present tense
    
##What am I responsible for to help me get unstuck?
##What are others responsible for to help me get unstuck?

1. My code is blowing up?
- Read the error and find the right error line
- When in doubt, p it out 
- Print the variables near the error lines

2. I don't know how to get started
- Pseudo-code
- Google

#Git exercises
make a new local repo, initialize, add, commit, make exact folder on github, add remote and push

#Classes
My boss wants me to keep track of two employees using ruby code. They have 4 pieces of info - Name, Salary, Active

#Ways to store info
- hash
    * learned about symbols
- array
- class

##Exercises
- Read more about Ruby’s hash symbol syntax:
<http://alwayscoding.ca/momentos/2012/06/15/ruby-hash-syntax-hashrocket-vs-json-style/>

- Read more about how attr_reader works its magic (advanced stuff here)

* <https://gist.github.com/riceb53/9bfa91d521f5e6ef8dfd894ddb4e3fb8>
    + Copy and paste the code from the above gist into a new file called employee.rb.
    + Create a new method in your class called full_name. It should return the first name combined with the last name. Also, if the last name ends with the letter s, it should add an “Esquire” at the end. 
    + employee1.full_name should return “Majora Carter”
    + employee2.full_name should return “Danilo Campos, Esquire”
    + Rewrite the initialize method to provide default values if they are missing from the options hash.

#notes
- stop writing 12 lines of code before running it.
- write fewer lines and then test.
- stay DRY and not WET (write everything twice)

#inheritance
- you can only inherit from one class but there can be a chain of inheritances.
- if you have a duplicate method in the child class, ruby will run that method instead of looking in the inherited class.
- learned how to make a new parent class

##`super`
- The way super handles arguments is as follows:
    - When you invoke super with no arguments Ruby sends a message to the parent of the current object, asking it to invoke a method of the same name as the method invoking super. It automatically forwards the arguments that were passed to the method from which it's called.
    - Called with an empty argument list - `super()`-it sends no arguments to the higher-up method, even if arguments were passed to the current method.
    - Called with specific arguments - `super(a, b, c)` - it sends exactly those arguments.

##other new terms
- attr_reader
- attr_writer
- attr_accessor

##hot keys for sublime
- <http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_osx.html>

###Exercise 1
- Create a new file called inheritance_example.rb and open it in Sublime.
- Copy the Car and Bicycle class into your file: <https://gist.github.com/peterxjang/e9b69b4de36b2c41ef4b> 
- Use inheritance to DRY up the classes. Note - a car is NOT a type of bicycle, and a bicycle is NOT a type of car!
- To test it, create a bicycle and car instance from your newly modified classes (you can create them at the bottom of your file). First, have them accelerate. Then, make sure a bike can “Ring ring!” and a car "Beeeeeeep!"
- Bonus: Read more about inheritance and object hierarchy in Ruby here: >https://www.leighhalliday.com/object-hierarchy-in-ruby>

###Exercise 2
- Create a new file called manager.rb. Paste in the code from <https://github.com/acltc/object-oriented-ruby/blob/498e769ae3d93df6b1562ad8e84bd8a1aeda398c/manager.rb> 
- Create a method in the Manager class called give_all_raises that loops through each of the manager’s employees and gives them a raise (using the give_annual_raise method). Demonstrate how it works.
- Create a method in the Manager class called fire_all_employees that loops through each of the manager’s employees and changes their active status to false. (note - you’ll have to modify the Employee class in order to accomplish this!)
- Bonus: What happens when you define a method in the Employee and Manager class with the same name? Read more about method overriding here: http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_overriding_methods.html

###Exercise 3
- Open the inheritance_example.rb file from the previous example.
- Add car specific attributes to the Car class (fuel, make, model, etc.) and bicycle specific attributes to the Bicycle class (speed, type, weight, etc.). - Use the super method to keep the initialize methods DRY.
- Open the store_item.rb file you created from the previous lesson.
Some of your store items are food, which have a shelf life. Create a class called Food which inherits from your original class and has an additional property of shelf_life.
- Bonus: Read about the differences between redefining, overriding, and super. Complete the exercise at the end to get the tests to pass: https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/37-classes-inheritance/lessons/88-redefining-overriding-and-super

###Modules
* anyone who can perform the functions of the module can use it.
* is different from inheritance
    - don't need to make child inherit `<`
    - use `include Module`
    - Modules are about providing methods that you can use across multiple classes - think about them as "libraries" (as you would see in a Rails app). Classes are about objects; modules are about functions.
    - For example, authentication and authorization systems are good examples of modules. Authentication systems work across multiple app-level classes (users are authenticated, sessions manage authentication, lots of other classes will act differently based on the auth state), so authentication systems act as shared APIs.
    - You might also use a module when you have shared methods across multiple apps (again, the library model is good here).

|	|class |module |
|-----|:-----:|------:                     
|instantiation |can be instantiated |can *not* be instantiated |     
|usage |object creation |mixin facility. provide a namespace. |   
|superclass |module |object |
|methods  |class methods and instance methods  | module methods and instance methods |
|inheritance |inherits behaviour and can be base for inheritance  | No inheritance |                               
|inclusion |cannot be included | can be included in classes and modules by using the include command (includes all instance methods as instance methods in a class/module) |
|extension |cannot extend with extend command (only with inheritance) | module can extend instance by using extend command (extends given instance with singleton methods from module) |   

###Structure
* Should seperate files into classes
    - require relative
    - require
    - load
* Good to name module or class the same name as file name

###Initialize methods in modules (bad idea)
- Doesn't make sense in the real world
- Initialize is: when I make a new class, I run this method

##Name Spacing
- Don't have classes of the same name (bad)
- ###Ruby Gems
    + Most times a class will be put inside of a module
        - **object = Module::Class.new**

###Exercise1
 - Wrap your store item files in a module called StoreFront. (note that class names aren’t named with snake case)

###Pair Programming
- Overall Ruby review
- Explain pair programming (check-in, driver, navigator)
- Share Whirlwind Ruby exercises, students work in pairs <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z7DaCGEwPKQOQptvBD8jd_XCSMkPBc1fW-igdZcj6a8/edit> 
- Share OOP exercise <https://gist.github.com/peterxjang/0164f3426579fef3128a>

##CSS and HTML
- **missed first 19 minutes :-(**
- change style only in CSS
- id's can only be used once
- classes can be used more than once
- a `.` is a CSS selector
- `#` is for classes
- `<div>` will separate contact and put it below the previous `<div>` tag
- `width: inherit`
    + takes the width from `<main>` and applies it that child class
- `overflow: hidden`
    + ???
- `overflow: scroll`
    + vertical scroll bar
- Media queries (??)

###Exercise 1
