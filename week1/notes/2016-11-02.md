###Modules
* anyone who can perform the functions of the module can use it.
* is different from inheritance
    - don't need to make child inherit `<`
    - use `include Module`
    - Modules are about providing methods that you can use across multiple classes - think about them as "libraries" (as you would see in a Rails app). Classes are about objects; modules are about functions.
    - For example, authentication and authorization systems are good examples of modules. Authentication systems work across multiple app-level classes (users are authenticated, sessions manage authentication, lots of other classes will act differently based on the auth state), so authentication systems act as shared APIs.
    - You might also use a module when you have shared methods across multiple apps (again, the library model is good here).

|	|class	|module |
|-------|:-----:|-------:                        
|instantiation	|can be instantiated	|can *not* be instantiated  |     

|usage		|object creation	|mixin facility. provide a namespace.|   |superclass	|module			|object |
|methods        |class methods and instance methods|  module methods and|instance methods |
|inheritance    |inherits behaviour and can be base for inheritance| No inheritance|                  
                                                    
|inclusion      |cannot be included | can be included in classes and modules by using the include command (includes all instance methods as instance methods in a class/module) |
|extension      |can not extend with extend command (only with inheritance) |   module can extend instance by using extend command (extends 
given instance with singleton methods from module) |   

###Structure
* Should seperate files into classes
    - require relative
    - require
    - load
* Good to name module or class the same name as file name

###Initialize methods in modules (bad idea)
- Doesn't make sense in the real world
- Initialize is: when I make a new class, I run this method

##Name Spacing
- Don't have classes of the same name (bad)
- ###Ruby Gems
    + Most times a class will be put inside of a module
        - **object = Module::Class.new**

###Exercise1
 - Wrap your store item files in a module called StoreFront. (note that class names arenâ€™t named with snake case)

###Pair Programming
- Overall Ruby review
- Explain pair programming (check-in, driver, navigator)
- Share Whirlwind Ruby exercises, students work in pairs <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z7DaCGEwPKQOQptvBD8jd_XCSMkPBc1fW-igdZcj6a8/edit> 
- Share OOP exercise <https://gist.github.com/peterxjang/0164f3426579fef3128a>
